# Arduino Leonardo

## SPI problems
Arduino Leonardo doesn't have SPI connected to the female headers on its sides, SPI is only connected to the ICSP 6-pin header on the back of the board. The pinout can be seen in the following image.

> Note that there are multiple pinout images around the internet that show the SPI pins connected to the side female headers.
