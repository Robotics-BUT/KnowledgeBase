There are several modules with this chip and the matrix itself for example the FC-16, which either comes with a single 8x8 matrix or 4 of these combined together forming a 64x8 matrix display.

A library that can be used to jumpstart the development is the [MD_MAX72XX](https://github.com/MajicDesigns/MD_MAX72xx) library and for animations and scrolling the [MD_Parola](https://github.com/MajicDesigns/MD_Parola) library can be easily used.
